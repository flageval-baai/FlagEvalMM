Each point should be represented as a normalized (x, y) tuple, where both x and y values are floats between 0 and 1, corresponding to the position within the image (e.g., for a point at pixel (50, 75) in a 100*100 image, the normalized coordinate is (0.5, 0.75)).

Format your final answer strictly as follows on the last line of your response:
Answer: [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)]
